## Dependencies

The sample application uses the Serverless Application Model to build and deploy. requires the following dependencies:

* [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html)

* [Python3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

* Optional: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) if deploying and testing locally

## Installing Python Dependencies

The local testing environment makes use of dependencies in the project's [Pipfile](./Pipfile). These dependencies need to be installed by running the following command:

```bash
make install
```

## What's Next?

Now that you have your project dependencies installed, you can [build and interact with the API locally](./README-INTERACTING-LOCALLY.md).
